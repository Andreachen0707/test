# gmv_opt_test
### Things to know
1. Do not contain opencv2 framework and GMV library
2. Main code is in ViewController.mm
3. Preview is in gray scale

### Things to solve
1. The optical flow part really need to improve. Since there are not enough 'good features' on human face, i.e.corners, the optical flow part sometimes goes wrong.
2. Mark the points in RGB image? hmmmm, still need to learn how.
