# gmv_opt_test
Do not contain opencv2 framework and GMV library
problems:
i). how to make it work under protrait orientation?

ii). how to track more points at the same time?

iii). how to convert GMV(rgb) and optical flow(gray) into one preview image

iv). why does the point mark wrongly on the preview?
